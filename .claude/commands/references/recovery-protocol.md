# Recovery Protocol — Recovery after interruption or failure

How to detect, diagnose, and resume when something breaks along the way.
Referenced by `/new-feature`, `/implement`, `/bug-fix`.

---

## 1. Detecting the current state

When resuming an interrupted pipeline (`/new-feature --continue`):

```text
READ IMMEDIATELY:
1. .product/pipeline-state.json → Where were we?
2. git log --oneline -10        → Which commits were made?
3. git status                   → Is there uncommitted work left?
4. pytest --tb=line -q          → Do the tests still pass?
```

### Decision tree

```text
Does pipeline-state.json exist?
├── YES → Read current_step
│   ├── discovery/specs/architecture → Resume this step (no code written)
│   ├── implement → Check stories_completed vs stories_total
│   │   ├── All completed → Move on to qa-tests
│   │   └── Partially → Resume at story N+1
│   ├── qa_tests → Re-run the tests
│   ├── security → Re-run the audit
│   └── push → Resume the cleanup
└── NO → No pipeline in progress, start from scratch
```

## 2. Resuming by phase

### Resuming /implement (most common case)

```text
Situation: implement crashed at story 3 of 6

1. Check the committed stories:
   git log --oneline | grep "feat(eval"
   → Should list the US-1, US-2 commits

2. Check that the committed stories hold:
   pytest tests/ --tb=short -q
   → If pass: resume at US-3
   → If fail: see "Regression after interruption" below

3. Check the state of uncommitted code:
   git diff --stat
   → If some US-3 code is in progress: assess whether it is salvageable
   → If too broken: git checkout -- . and restart US-3

4. Resume:
   Update pipeline-state.json with the current stories_completed
   Continue with US-3 normally
```

### Regression after interruption

```text
Situation: tests that used to pass no longer pass

1. Identify the culprit commit:
   git log --oneline -5
   git stash  # save the work in progress
   pytest --tb=short -q
   → If pass: the problem is in the uncommitted code
   → If fail: bisect to find the commit

2. If the uncommitted code is the culprit:
   git stash pop
   Analyze the diff: git diff
   Fix the code, not the test
   Re-run the tests

3. If a commit is the culprit:
   Option A: Fix in a new commit (preferred)
     → fix(eval-api): repair regression from US-N
   Option B: Revert the commit if the story is too broken
     → git revert [commit-hash]
     → Restart the story cleanly
   NEVER Option C: modify the test so it passes
```

### Resuming /qa-tests

```text
Situation: the QA tests reveal a bug in the code

1. Identify the responsible story:
   Which endpoint/service is at fault?
   Which commit introduced it?

2. Fix in the service (not in the test):
   fix(eval-api): US-N — handle [edge case]

3. Re-run the full QA suite
   → The old tests must still pass
   → The new test must pass too

4. NEVER delete a QA test that fails
   → The test is right, the code is wrong
```

### Resuming /security-audit

```text
Situation: a security fix breaks tests

1. Is the fix correct?
   → If yes: adapt the tests to the new security constraints
   → If no: review the fix

2. Example: we add strict Pydantic validation
   → The tests that were sending invalid payloads now fail
   → This is NORMAL: adapt the tests, not the fix
```

## 3. Retry limits

```text
RULE: 3 attempts max per story/step

Attempt 1: Try the initial approach
Attempt 2: Alternative approach (different pattern, different structure)
Attempt 3: Simplified approach (reduce the scope of the story)

If 3 failures:
  → STOP
  → Document the blocker in pipeline-state.json:
    "stories": {
      "US-3": {
        "status": "blocked",
        "attempts": 3,
        "blockers": ["Description of the problem"],
        "workaround": "Possible if we split into 2 stories"
      }
    }
  → Ask the user for help
  → Continue with the following stories if they are independent
```

---

## 4. Saving partial progress

```text
BEFORE attempting a risky fix:
1. git stash -m "WIP: US-N before risky fix"
2. Attempt the fix
3. If OK: git stash drop
4. If KO: git stash pop (restore the previous state)

RULE: never lose code that was working.
Prefer a temporary WIP commit over lost code.
```

## 5. User escalation

When to escalate (don't waste time):

```text
ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY if:
- Infra error (Docker, DB, Redis down)
- Non-trivial merge conflict (> 3 files)
- Undocumented missing dependency
- Unexpected behavior from a third-party lib
- Business question ("is this use case valid?")

DO NOT ESCALATE if:
- Failing test (analyze first)
- mypy error (fix or ignore with a reason)
- File too big (refactor)
- Circular import (reorganize)
```
